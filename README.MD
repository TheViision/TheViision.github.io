# Project: Frame Craft

## Project Description:

For this assignment the class was tasked on designing and constructing a website to display a film(s) produced in collaborative groups for the 30-Minute Film Festival (30MFF). This venture necessitated the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to not only present the film but also to encapsulate an immersive experience for its audience. The project's ethos was rooted in the charm and inventiveness of stop motion animation, aiming to reflect these qualities in the website's design and user interface. This approach was intended to resonate with the creative spirit of the festival's submission, employing stop motion as a fundamental theme.

## Process:

My approach to the project was marked by a conscious acknowledgment of my nascent skills in interactive media and website creation, coupled with a resolute determination to channel my creativity within a well-defined framework, always keeping usability at the forefront. I chose to employ bright colors and rounded shapes in the design, intending to foster a warm and inviting atmosphere. This design strategy was not only about appealing to newcomers but also about subtly echoing the intricate beauty of stop motion animation that characterized our collaborative 30MFF film.

In crafting the background art, I opted for a blend of pixel art and images that depict the behind-the-scenes magic of stop motion creation. This strategic choice served to balance the vibrant design elements, ensuring that the visual narrative complements rather than overwhelms the user experience, while still reinforcing the thematic core of the project.

Furthermore, interactive features like popup bubbles that appear when users hover over certain images on the homepage, were woven into the design to enhance engagement and interaction, mirroring the captivating nature of stop motion animation. This element was designed to invite users to dive deeper into the website, promoting a sense of discovery and active participation.

## Reflection/Evaluation:

Reflecting on the FrameCraft project, I view it as a resounding success that achieved its initial goals, effectively capturing the essence of stop motion animation and delivering an engaging, user-friendly platform for viewers. However, the journey wasnâ€™t devoid of learning opportunities, particularly in the realm of JavaScript integration. The execution in some sections was less smooth than anticipated, which decelerated the development pace. Looking ahead, I believe that honing my JavaScript skills and enhancing my planning strategies will enable a more streamlined development process and elevate the overall user experience.

This project has been a profound learning experience, illuminating the vital role of patience in web development. From addressing technical challenges to refining design details, every step reinforced the notion that dedication and time are indispensable ingredients in the recipe for success. Armed with these insights, I am now more prepared than ever to embark on future projects, equipped with a deeper understanding of what it takes to transform creative visions into digital realities.
