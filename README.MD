# Project: Frame Craft

## Project Description:

The objective of the FrameCraft project was to design and construct a website that would exhibit a film produced in collaboration for the 30-Minute Film Festival (30MFF). The requirement was for the website to include elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The overarching concept and theme aimed at offering an immersive and accessible experience for visitors, simultaneously reflecting the collaborative film's theme, which prominently featured stop motion animation.

Stop motion animation, known for its meticulous attention to detail and imaginative storytelling, provided the inspiration for this endeavor. The aspiration was for the website to echo the charm and creativity inherent in stop motion, whilst ensuring a user-friendly interface that would allow visitors to navigate and explore with ease.

## Process:

Approaching the project with an awareness of limitations and objectives, particularly given the relative inexperience in interactive media and website creation, there was a deliberate focus on creativity within a clearly defined scope, prioritizing usability.

The decision to use bright colors and rounded shapes in the websiteâ€™s design was driven by the intention to create a welcoming and accessible aesthetic. This design choice sought to attract newcomers and subtly mirror the stop motion theme present in the collaborative 30MFF video.

In the creation of background art, a mix of pixel art and images depicting the process of creating stop motion was used. This choice provided a contrast to the vibrant design elements, preventing visual overload for the user while reinforcing the project's thematic elements.

For JavaScript functionality, the implementation focused on interactive popup bubbles activated by mouse hover over key images on the landing page. This feature was designed to engage users and promote interaction, reflecting the inherently captivating nature of stop motion animation.

## Reflection/Evaluation:

In retrospect, the FrameCraft project is considered a success in alignment with its initial concept and objectives. The website effectively captures the essence of stop motion animation and offers an engaging, user-friendly experience for its visitors.

Despite its successes, there are identified areas for improvement, notably in the integration of JavaScript. The execution of JavaScript in certain sections of the website did not proceed as smoothly as intended, impacting the development pace. A future focus on refining JavaScript skills and enhancing planning efficiency is believed to streamline the development process and improve the user experience.

Moreover, the project has imparted significant lessons in web design and development, highlighting the critical role of patience throughout the creation process. From addressing technical challenges to perfecting design elements, patience has been underscored as a vital component. With these insights, there is a renewed commitment to approaching future projects with an enhanced appreciation for the time and dedication required to realize a web-based vision.
