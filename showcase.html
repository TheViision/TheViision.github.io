                    The video showcased on my website is the result of a spontaneous brainstorming session with my groupmate, where our imaginations took flight and we embarked on a creative journey fueled by passion and a desire to push the boundaries of stop motion animation. Our vision was ambitious yet wonderfully ambiguousâ€”we aimed to synchronize every movement with the rhythm and energy of the music, creating an immersive and interactive experience for the viewer that transcends traditional storytelling.

                    Inspired by the iconic song "Flash" by Queen, we were drawn to its pulsating beat and electrifying energy, which served as the perfect canvas for our creative exploration. Our process was spontaneous and collaborative, with each of us bringing our own unique perspective and creative flair to the table wanting to add our own creative spin on what is considered stop motion.
